            Returns the options that should be applied to this document. This consists of global options from <see cref="P:Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Solution.Options"/>,

            This method is async because this may require reading other files. It is expected this is cheap and synchronous in most cases due to caching.</remarks>

        <member name="T:dnSpy.Roslyn.Internal.SmartIndent.IndentationResult">
            <summary>
            An indentation result represents where the indent should be placed.  It conveys this through
            a pair of values.  A position in the existing document where the indent should be relative,
            and the number of columns after that the indent should be placed at.  
            
            This pairing provides flexibility to the implementor to compute the indentation results in
            a variety of ways.  For example, one implementation may wish to express indentation of a 
            newline as being four columns past the start of the first token on a previous line.  Another
            may wish to simply express the indentation as an absolute amount from the start of the 
            current line.  With this tuple, both forms can be expressed, and the implementor does not
            have to convert from one to the other.

            The base position in the document that the indent should be relative to.  This position
            can occur on any line (including the current line, or a previous line).
